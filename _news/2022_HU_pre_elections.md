If you are interested in the upcoming Hungarian elections, we wrote 1) [a short blogpost in German on the effects of the war](https://wzb.eu/de/forschung/krieg-in-europa-ursachen-und-folgen/die-wahlen-in-ungarn-im-schatten-des-russischen-krieges-in-der-ukraine){:target="\_blank"}; and 2) [a longer analysis in English on the party offer](https://precede.eu/index.php/2022/04/01/blog-the-electoral-dynamics-of-the-hungarian-elections-2022/){:target="\_blank"}. Both are the result of a cooperation with the [PRECEDE project](https://precede.eu/){:target="\_blank"}, partly based on their [voting advice application](https://valasztasi-iranytu.org/hu/){:target="\_blank"}.
