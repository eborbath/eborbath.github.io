After some consideration, I have decided to attend APSA and a [pre-conference on the political economy of climate and the environment](https://pece.polisci.ucla.edu).

On August 30th at 11:00 am I'll be presenting the paper "Environmental Protests in Europe" at the UCLA Luskin Conference Center.

On the same day, same place, at 14:00, I give a flash talk on a proposal I've been working on, entitled "The new climate change divide".

On Aug. 31, at 8:00 AM I'll present on "How Do Voters Respond to Party Brands?" at the LACC, 513.

If you are in the area & want to meet up, let me know! ðŸ‘‹
