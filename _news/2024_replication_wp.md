I have contributed to the new working paper ['Mass Reproducibility and Replicability: A New Hope'](https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/zbwi4rdps/107.htm){:target="\_blank"}. I co-authored a replication report on Manekin and Mitts (2022) together with Jan Fabian Dollbaum (University College Dublin, European University Institute) and Jan Matti Dollbaum (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München). The report is available [here](https://www.rwi-essen.de/i4r-discussion-papers-series-1/a-comment-on-manekin-mitts-2022-effective-23120103){:target="\_blank"}.
