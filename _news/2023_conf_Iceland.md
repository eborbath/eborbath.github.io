I will be present our work on the environmental protests at the Council of European Studies conference in Reykjavik, co-authored with Swen Hutter.

If you are around, join the amazing panel on political participation and collective action on Wednesday at 4:00 PM in room N-121, Askja.

I am looking forward to seeing many of you!
