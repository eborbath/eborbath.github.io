New paper with Pál Susánszky ['Party system transformation from below: protests by Jobbik and LMP'](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41269-024-00342-w){:target="\_blank"}. We examine how the protest presence of Jobbik and LMP contributed to the transformation of the Hungarian party system. We use two datasets of protest events and trace these parties from the first Jobbik sponsored event in 2002 to the 2022 elections.
