I am a Junior Professor of Empirical-Analytical Participation Research at the [Institute of Political Science](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/politikwissenschaften/){:target="_blank"} at Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg, where I also lead the Emmy Noether Research Group on *The New Climate Divide*. I am a guest researcher at the [Center for Civil Society Research](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/trans-sectoral-research/center-for-civil-society-research){:target="_blank"} at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center.

__My research focuses on__ mass mobilization amidst transformations in European cleavage structures, shaped by the rising salience of climate change, immigration, and European integration. I bridge perspectives from comparative politics and political sociology by examining both the supply and demand sides: party competition and movement mobilization on the supply side, and individual-level participation and group identities on the demand side. Empirically, I primarily use quantitative methods and analyze data derived from media coverage of electoral and protest politics, as well as individual-level surveys and survey experiments. Geographically, my research focuses on Western, Central, and Eastern Europe.

My __research interests__ include: Comparative Politics &#8226; Political Sociology &#8226; Political Participation &#8226; Social Movements &#8226; Party Competition &#8226; Democracy &#8226; Civil Society &#8226; Cleavages &#8226; Environmental Politics &#8226; Climate Change &#8226; Western Europe &#8226; Central and Eastern Europe &#8226; Research Methods.

__Previously__, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Freie Universität Berlin and at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center. I received my PhD in December 2018 from the European University Institute. Prior to that, I completed the Political Science MA program at Central European University with a focus on electoral politics. You can find my more detailed [CV here]({{ '/cv/' | relative_url }}).
