## Office Hours

If youâ€™d like to book a slot during my office hours (**online only** during the semester break), please use my Calendly booking system:

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0;">
  <a href="https://calendly.com/endre-borbath/office-hour" class="col col-sm-2" target="_blank">
    ðŸ“… Book Office Hours via Calendly
  </a>
</div>

**How it works:**  
- Appointments are first come, first served.  
- If you need to cancel, please do so directly in Calendly â€” no need to email me.

## Supervision of Theses

Interested in having me supervise your BA or MA thesis?  
- Please first review my research topics on the [home page]({{ '/' | relative_url }}) and check my recent [publications]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}).  
- I generally supervise theses **only if your topic aligns with my research interests**.
- Supervision is possible in both **English** and **German**.
